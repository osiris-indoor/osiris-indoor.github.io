# Binaries 
Download the sandbox here: [Osiris sandbox](https://github.com/osiris-indoor/osiris/releases).

The sandbox will run the server. Remember to import a map before starting to use the web services. It is also possible to build the Android client application but in this case be sure to have the right values for the IP and port in configuration file.
